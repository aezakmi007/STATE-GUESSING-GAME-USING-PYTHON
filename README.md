# STATE-GUESSING-GAME-USING-PYTHON

The idea behind this project is to guess the names of the states of America and if you have entered the correct state name then that name will be mapped on the country picture at its original position and your score will be increased by 1

For creating the visual part of the project I have used turtle module of python.
For matching the entered data and the correct data I have stored the data in .csv file from there I have extracted the data using python panda module
